## Change blindness task
> Contributors: Jaquiery

People routinely fail to notice that changes have occurred within a visual scene if they do not perceive the changes occurring, a phenomenon known as ‘change blindness’ (Simons and Levin, 1998; Rensink et al, 1997).
Typical lab-based change blindness studies use static stimuli and require participants to identify simple changes such as alterations in stimulus orientation or scene composition (Hughes et al, 2012; Lyyra et al, 2014; Gaspar et al, 2013).
Changes are detected when the transients (moment-to-moment variations) accompanying a change are registered and prompt an explicit comparison between a stored representation of a stimulus and its current presentation (Simons and Ambinder, 2005; Mitroff et al, 2004).
Here, the the 'flicker' change blindness paradigm (Rensink et al, 1997) is extended to include moving stimuli where the change to be detected is a change in the trajectory of the target stimulus.

Participants completed a total of 20 trials. 
In 30% of the trials, the presented display consists of 2 rectangles, while in the remaining 70% of the trials the presented display consists of 5 rectangles. 
Half of the trials contain a change in movement trajectory and the other half contain a change in orientation. 
What change occurs on a specific trial is allocated randomly and participants are not told which type of change will occur. 
The stimulus displays prior and after the change are presented for 700ms each. On half of the trials, the switch from the initial display to the changed display is interrupted by a mask (a blank screen) presented for 200ms.
On the other half of the trials, there is no interruption between the initial and changed displays.
A screenshot of the task screen and a schematic of the structure of each trial is shown in Fig 1.

After 700ms one of the rectangles would alter either its orientation or its trajectory by 90° or 270°. The task for the participants was to identify which of the rectangles had undergone this change. In the simple scene condition only two rectangles were presented; the complex scene condition presented six rectangles as shown. right) ‘Flicker’ paradigm procedure. The initial scene (A) was displayed for 700ms, then a mask was put up for 200ms (masked condition) or 0ms (unmasked condition) before the initial scene was replaced with the altered scene (A’). The altered scene was displayed for 700ms and then masked and reverted to the initial scene. The process was repeated until the participant generated a response.](img/figure1.png)
